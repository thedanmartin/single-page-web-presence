<h2>Now</h2>

  I'm a first year student in the Technical Communication and Information Design M.S. program
  at Illinois Institute of Technology. This semester I'm taking courses in Standards-Based Web
  Design (COM 530) and Knowledge Management (COM 542). I'm also a Teaching Assistant for History
  of World Architecture (AAH 119) and the book review assistant for HOPOS Journal.

<h2>Then</h2>

  I used to work for the University of Chicago Press Journals Division in a variety of production
  roles. My undergraduate time was spent at Michigan Technological University. I'm originally
  from Houghton, Michigan, but I've lived in Chicago for 10 years.

<h2>Also Now</h2>

  I'm interested in learning about all types of publishing technologies, open access publishing,
  web forums, geography, and whatever else ya got.

  In my spare time I like watching hockey or soccer, listening to music, riding my bike, and
  making/eating food.

  You can find me on the internet all over the place, but specifically here:

    <ul>
    <li>twitter</li>
    <li>github</li>
    </ul>

  Sometimes you can find me irl in 200 Siegel Hall on IIT's campus.
