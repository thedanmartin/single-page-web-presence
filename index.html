<h2>Now</h2>

I'm a first year student in the Technical Communication and Information Design M.S. program at Illinois Institute of Technology. This semester I'm taking courses in Standards-Based Web Design (COM 530) and Knowledge Management (COM 542). I'm also a Teaching Assistant for History of World Architecture (AAH 119) and the book review assistant for HOPOS Journal.

<h2>Then</h2>

I used to work for the University of Chicago Press Journals Division in a variety of production roles. My undergraduate time was spent at Michigan Technological University. I'm originally from Houghton, Michigan, but I've lived in Chicago for 10 years.

<h2>Also Now</h2>

I'm interested in learning about all types of publishing technologies, open access publishing, web forums, geography, and whatever else ya got.

In my spare time I like watching hockey or soccer, listening to music, riding my bike, and making/eating food.

You can find me on the internet all over the place, but specifically here:

<li>twitter</li>
<li>github</li>
</ul>

Sometimes you can find me irl in 200 Siegel Hall.
