single-page-web-presence
========================

Second project for Karl Stolley's COM 530 course.

These files comprise my second project for COM 530, the single page web presence. I presented a preliminary draft of this page
on 10/1/2014, before it was working the way I envisioned. I've since fixed the problems I was having, mostly involving the
background image and footer. I have uploaded all images included in the page as well as the source and style sheet. If necessary,
reconstructing the 10/1 page should be possible with files in this repository.
